# Modify to your local settings, rename and place in one of the following:

#   - /etc/orca.yml
#   - ~/.orca/config.yml

# The IP address of the local device. Reflectors listen on this address,
# generators send pings to this device. Note this must be a well formed IP
# address with a port, optionally; and will be resolved as follows:
#   192.168.1.1:0 --> 192.168.1.1:3265
#   null --> autoip:3265
#   :4444 --> autoip:4444
# where autoip automatically detects the external ip address of the machine
# and the default port of the app is 3265.

# The path to the sqlite database that stores ping information
# By default this is stored in ~/.orca/orca.db
